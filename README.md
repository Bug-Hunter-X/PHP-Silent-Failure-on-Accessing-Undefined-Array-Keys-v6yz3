# PHP Silent Failure on Accessing Undefined Array Keys

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle issue in PHP: the silent handling of accessing undefined array keys.  Attempting to access a key that doesn't exist in a PHP array doesn't result in an error, but instead returns NULL, which can lead to unexpected behavior and difficult debugging.

The `bug.php` file shows the problematic code. The `bugSolution.php` offers a solution using `isset()` to check for key existence before accessing it, thereby preventing unexpected null values and making the code more robust.

This example highlights the importance of defensive programming in PHP to handle potential errors gracefully and avoid unexpected outputs.
