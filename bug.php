In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with array keys that are not explicitly defined.  Consider this example:

```php
<?php
$myArray = [];
$myArray["a"] = 1;
$myArray["b"] = 2;
echo $myArray["c"]; // Notice the undefined key "c"
?>
```

Instead of producing a proper error, PHP silently returns an empty string or null, depending on the context, leading to unexpected behavior and difficult-to-debug issues. The code executes without a warning or error, but the missing key produces an unintended outcome.

This behavior contrasts with more strict languages that would likely throw an exception for accessing undefined array elements.
